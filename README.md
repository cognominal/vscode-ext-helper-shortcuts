# helper-shortcuts README

This is the README for the [shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cognominal.shortcuts) vscode [extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace). 
Access  the keyboard shortcuts using a [quick pick](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/ux-guidelines/quick-picks)
similar to the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).

This is a complement to other commands
related to [keyboard shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) :
`Preferences: Open Keyboare shortcuts` and
`Help: Keyboard shortcut Reference`.
The former is too comprehensive to be used as a reminder, the latter is a pdf opened outside vscode which is a
bummer. `shortcuts` is broken in section with the same name as the pdf so it will look familiar.


## Features

- [TBD] This is driven by a `helper-shortcuts.json` file  and 
`helper-shortcuts`

so you can customize it per [profile](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles), per [workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces)
